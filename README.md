### Overview
Burger logger that logs a burger that has been served/eaten. The user can add a new burger, move a burger from served to devoured, or deleted from the list.

### Technologies used
* HTML, CSS
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MySQL
* Handlebars
* Homebrew ORM

### The Goal
This small web was created to fulfill the requirements of the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp and demonstrates an understanding of developing a full-stack web application using an MVC file structure. The database was created using MySQL and the main goal of this assignment was to create a homebrew ORM that demonstrates an understanding of the role ORMs fill in an application.

### Description
* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
